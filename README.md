Hi! I’m Andres Bass, a cybersecurity student passionate about penetration testing, ethical hacking, and building practical skills to secure systems. I'm currently diving deep into pentesting using tools like Kali Linux, Wireshark, and Snort to analyze networks and find vulnerabilities. My goal is to work in penetration testing or offensive security, helping organizations understand their security flaws before attackers do.
Right now, I'm working on a personal project using a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux to explore Wi-Fi hacking and security assessments. Through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, I’ve been building up my skills and learning to think like an attacker to strengthen my defense strategies.

What I've Been Working On:
- Raspberry Pi Kali Linux Setup: Set up a Kali Linux environment on a Raspberry Pi for ethical hacking, specifically focusing on Wi-Fi pentesting and wireless security testing.

- Wi-Fi Hacking: Exploring tools like Aircrack-ng and Reaver for testing the strength of WPA2 passwords and learning about wireless encryption vulnerabilities.

- Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis: Capturing and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark to spot vulnerabilities, suspicious activity, and security flaws in network protocols.

- Snort for Intrusion Detection: Configured and used Snort for intrusion detection in a test network to understand real-time attack detection and prevention.

- Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges: Participated in CTF games to improve my problem-solving skills in areas like web exploitation, cryptography, and reverse engineering.

- FoxyProxy for Network Analysis: Used FoxyProxy to manage proxy settings and analyze traffic patterns while testing the security of web applications and connections.
