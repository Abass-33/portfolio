  <h1>Hi, I’m Andres</h1>
  <p>
  I’m a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in learning how to defend systems, protect data, and understand how real-world security threats work. I started my journey with a focus on database security and operating systems, and I’m currently expanding my skills in ethical hacking, network analysis, and digital forensics through hands-on labs and class projects. I’ve worked with tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, and PowerShell, and I’m actively building a portfolio of projects to demonstrate what I’ve learned.
</p>
<p>
  My short-term goal is to gain experience in the field through internships or entry-level roles in cybersecurity or IT support. Long term, I’m interested in roles related to threat hunting, OSINT, or penetration testing. I created this site to showcase my growth and signal my commitment to employers and the cybersecurity community. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and I’m excited to keep pushing forward in this fast-changing field.
